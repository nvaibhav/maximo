Granting access to a application
As an administrator, you must provide access to a application to users before they can view and use it from the navigation menu in Maximo.
Use an existing security group or create a security group and add the users to whom you want to give access to the application, to the security group. 
For more information about creating a security group, see Creating security groups.
To give access to a application , visit the security group you belong to , in the Applications tab search for the application and apply security template. 
Security templates are predefined permission for different objects in Maximo.
These objects permissions are required for a given application to work correctly.
Without the security template applied, the application might not function correctly or might be not accessible. 
The Security template needs to be applied for a desired application before using the application.
This security template can be applied in the Security Groups application in Maximo.
Once in the Security Groups application , select the applications where you want to apply the template, log out after saving and log back in.
